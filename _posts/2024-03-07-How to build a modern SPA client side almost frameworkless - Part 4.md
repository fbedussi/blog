Welcome to the fourth part of this series of post where we are building a modern client side single page application using the bare minimum amount of tooling necessary. 

In the [third part](https://fbedussi.github.io/blog/recipes/How-to-build-a-modern-SPA-client-side-almost-frameworkless-Part-3) we did a big step ahead introducing the routing. Now there is just one thing left to do: let the user update a note. It should be pretty straightforward by now, we just need to apply what we've learned so far.

<!--more-->

First of all, let's add an `updateNote` function in the `data.js`Â file:

```javascript
export const updateNote = async (note) => {
  const updatedData = await notes.value.map(oldNote => oldNote.id === note.id ? note : oldNote)
  notes.value = updatedData
  saveUpdatedData(updatedData)
}
```

Then, in the `single-page.js` file we need to add an `<input>` to edit the title and a `<textarea>` to edit the text:  

```javascript
<header>
  <h1><input value=${this.note.value?.title} onkeydown=${() => this.dirty.value = true}/></h1>
  <button onclick=${() => delNote(this.note.value.id)}>delete</button>
</header>
<main>
  <textarea value=${this.note.value?.text} onkeydown=${() => this.dirty.value = true}/>
</main>
```

When a key is pressed in either the input or the textarea we set the form as dirty, using the `this.dirty` signal, created in the `connectedCallback`: 

```javascript
this.dirty = signal(false)
```

We can use this signal to show a "save" button: 

```javascript
<footer>
  <a href="/">
    Go back
  </a>
  ${this.dirty.value ? html`<button>save</button>` : null}
</footer>
```

Since the button is in a form, clicking it will submit the form, we just need to add an onsubmit handler:

```javascript
<form onsubmit=${ev => {
  ev.preventDefault()

  updateNote({
    ...this.note.value,
    title: ev.target[0].value,
    text: ev.target[2].value,
  })
}}>
```

And that's it. This one was easy. There is just one small detail to fix, but we already know how to do it. Now the save button looks like this:

we can align it with the "go back" link using the `css` helper we wrote in the [part 2](https://fbedussi.github.io/blog/recipes/How-to-build-a-modern-SPA-client-side-almost-frameworkless-Part-2)

```javascript
constructor() {
      super()

      css`
        ${TAG} {
          footer {
            display: flex;
            align-items: center;
            justify-content: space-between;
          }
        }
      `
    }
```

And this is the result:

With this feature in place the application is basically completed. As usual, you can find all the code of this part in [this repo](https://github.com/fbedussi/frameworkless-spa-tutorial/tree/part4).

But we can do one more thing: add a build step. It is nice that we don't need it, but it is also nice to be able to add it, if we want. So, stay tuned for [the last part of this series](https://fbedussi.github.io/blog/recipes/How-to-build-a-modern-SPA-client-side-almost-frameworkless-Part-5).
