I started programming in 1985 on a Commodore 64, and never stopped since then. I work in the web industry since 2002. I started as a project leader, evolved into a front end developer, then a tech lead and finally a full stack developer.

Now I am a senior software engineer at [Prima Assicurazioni](https://prima.it).
