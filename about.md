I started programming in 1985 on a Commodore 64, and never stopped since then. I work in the web industry since 2002. At first as a project leader, then as a web designer and web master. In 2011 I switched to development and since then I've been a freelance, a full time front end developer, a tech lead and then a full stack developer.

Now I am a senior full stack developer and tech lead at [Abstract](https://abstract.it/it).
